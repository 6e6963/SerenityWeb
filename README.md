# Serenity website

Website for FFXIV FC Serenity on EU-Lich.

Minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript. CSS loosely based on Bootstrap conventions.

Screenshots taken from [this screenshot competition](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/d1a641ef48b81141c6488474d83796cdddc29b56). A slight blur mask was applied to the background to make the images compress better.

The JavaScript at the bottom of the homepage (`index.html`) dynamically changes the content of the page. It fetches information from XIVAPI and adds it to the 'About' section.

The Jekyll config (`_config.yml`) was added so GitHub Pages builds the website. The website is currently not using Jekyll or any other CMS.
